    <string name="description_1">"Negative numbers are numerical values that are less than zero. They are represented with a minus sign (-) in front of them. For example, -5 and -0.75 are negative numbers. On a number line, negative numbers are positioned to the left of zero."</string>
    <string name="description_2">"The opposite of a number refers to another number that is located on the opposite side of zero on the number line, while maintaining the same distance from zero. For example, -5 and 5, both have the same distance from zero and located on the opposite side of each other"</string>
    <string name="description_3">
        "When adding numbers with different signs, follow these steps: \n\n1. Find the absolute values of both numbers. \n\n2. Subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger one.\n\n3.Give the answer the same sign as the number with the greater absolute value.\n\nExample: (-10) + 5 = -5"

        "When subtracting a negative number, it’s equivalent to adding its positive counterpart.\n\nExample: (-16) - (-12) = -16 + 12 = -4"

    <string name="description_5">"Multiplying on positive numbers is just normal multiplication. Both numbers have the same sign, that is plus (+). For example 3 x 2 = 3 + 3 = 6"</string>
    <string name="description_6">"Multiplying on negative numbers is multiplying the numbers, but the result being positive numbers because minus multiplication with minus is positive. Just like the positive numbers multiplication. For example: (-3) x (-2) = +(3 x 2) = = 3 + 3 = 6" </string>
    <string name="description_7">"The result of multiplication between positive number and negative number is always negative number. For example: (-5) x 3 = - (5 + 5 + 5) = -15"</string>

    <string name="description_12">"The exponent of a number indicates the total time to use that number in a multiplication. For example, 3 × 3 × 3  can be expressed as 3^3 (3 power to 3) because 3 is multiplied by itself 3 times."</string>
    <string name="description_13">"Any numbers power to zero resulted 1. For example: 3^0 (3 power to 0) = 1 times nothing so it resulted one.

        "The sign\'s result of this exponents depends on the power number. If the power number is odd number, the sign\'s result is negative (-).

        "Sometimes we meet square root that doesn\'t have what\'s number times by itself equal to the number inside the square root.

We found 9 times 3 is 27. It became square root of 9 times square root of 3. Square root of 9 is 3, and square root of 3 stays the same because we can\'t simplify it anymore. The result is 3 times square root of 3."

        "Fractions is a numerical quantity that is not a whole number. 1/2 is a fraction. In 1/2, the numerator is 1, and the denominator is 2.\n\nHow to add fractions number? Let\'s take example of 1/2 + 1/2. In the fractions calculation, we need to see the denominators. If the denominators are the same (on this example both are 2), we just need to add the numerator which is 1 + 1, and the denominators stay 2. So the result is (1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. Denominators don\'t need to be added.\n\nIf the denominators different, for example, 1/3 + 1/2, we need to make the denominators have the same value.\n\n1. Multiply the first number numerator with the second number denominators, (1 x 2) / 3 + 1/2.\n\n2. Multiply the second number numerator with the first number denominators, (1 x 2) / 3 + (1 x 3) / 2.\n\n3.

If the denominator is either 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and so on, count the 0 digits, the number of digits behind point based on them. 5/10 denominator is 10, it has a 0 digit. So, it become 0.5\n\n2. Another example is 4/100, the denominator digit is 2. So, the digit behind point are 2. It become 0.04\n\n3. If it\'s 25/100, the denominator digit is 2. So, the digit behind point are 2, it become 0.25\n\n4. Another example is 2/25. We need to make the denominator either 10, 100, or 1000. We choose to change it to 100 because it already exceed 10. Multiply 2/25 with number that make 25 become 100. That number is 4. So, 2/25 x 25/25 = 50/100. There are two digits in 100. So, it become 0.5 or 0.50"

How to convert decimal to fractions? Let\'s take example from 0.5 and 0.04\n\n1. Check how much digits behind the point. We found one digit on example 0.5. Remove the point so it become 5. Since the digit behind point was one, we put 10 as the denominator. So, 5 is the numerator, and 10 is the denominator (5/10).\n\n2. Check how much digit behind the point of example 0.04. We found there are two digits. Remove the point so it become 4. Since the digits behind the point were 2, we put 100 as the denominator. So, 4 is the numerator, and 100 is the denominator (4/100)."
